    The Monty Hall Problem is a <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Monty_hall_problem">Probability Puzzle</a> based on the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal," hosted by Monty Hall. 
  </p>
  <p class="body-text">
    The problem is as follows: A contestant is presented with 3 doors. 
    Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. 
    After the contestant picks a door, Monty Hall, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. 
    The contestant is then given the choice to either stick with their original pick or switch to the other unopened door. 
    The question is - <span class='bold'>"Should the contestant switch to the other unopened door or stick with their current choice?"</span>

    This project aims to provide an interactive exploration of the Monty Hall Problem, demonstrating the probabilities involved and exploring conditional probability. 
    Further, it provides an interactive exploration of some variations of the Monty Hall problem, and explores the use of Bayes Theorem to arrive at the final answer.
